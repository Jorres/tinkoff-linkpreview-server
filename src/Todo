1) (easy) Write Javadocs to everything in the project
2) (easy) Implement logs rotation (now server logs are written into files with sequential numbers)
3) (medium) Change h2-in-memory database to something else, not in-memory (Postgres?)
4) (easy) Pack server-side app (and maybe even client-side) into docker images
5) (medium) Write comprehensive unit testing
6) (hard) Write some integrational tests involving both client and server
7) (medium) Make page parsing logic more complex, introduce more kinds of processed information
8) (medium) Put both applications into the cloud (like Heroku or Azure or Google Cloud)
9) (hard) Setup (Github? Gitlab?) CI\CD process and automate deployment

2) deploy mysql + everything on YaCloud and verify there (+)
3) write some functionality, keep in mind multithreading on corutines (+)
4) add spinner to web-app
